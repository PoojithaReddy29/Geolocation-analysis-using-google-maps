# Project: Google Maps Proximity Checker
# This project leverages Google Maps to add circumferences around locations fetched from a database and an additional array of locations. The primary functionality is to perform proximity checks, determining whether specific locations fall within the defined circumferences. This tool enhances geolocation analysis and database integration, providing precise and efficient location-based insights.
